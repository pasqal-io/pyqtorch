    A batched operation is an operation which efficiently applies a set of parametrized
    gates with parameters held by the `theta` argument on a set of input states held by
    the `state` argument. The number of gates and input states is the batch size. For 
    large batches, this gate is much faster than its standard non-batched version 

    Notice that for this operation to work the input state must also have been 
    initialized with its *last* dimension equal to the batch size. Use the

    # an error will be thrown
    out_state = batchedRX(batched_params, state, [0], nqubits)
